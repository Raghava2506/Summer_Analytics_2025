        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Data Preprocessing Pipeline\n",
        "The preprocessing pipeline transforms raw data through several critical steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class DataPreprocessor:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",

        "\n",
        "### 3.1 Model 1: Baseline Linear Model\n",
        "\n",
        "**Justification**: Provides a simple, interpretable baseline for price adjustments based solely on occupancy rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mathematical Formulation**:\n",
        "```\n",
        "P(t+1) = P(t) + α × OccupancyRate\n",
        "```\n",

        "**Implementation Rationale**:\n",
        "- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand for stakeholders\n",
        "- **Predictability**: Linear relationship provides consistent pricing behavior\n",
        "- **Baseline Performance**: Establishes minimum acceptable performance metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations**:\n",
        "- Single-factor dependency may not capture complex demand patterns\n",
        "- No consideration for external factors like traffic or events\n",
        "- Limited competitive intelligence\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.2 Model 2: Demand-Based Model (Primary Model)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Justification**: Incorporates multiple demand factors to create a sophisticated pricing mechanism that reflects real-world parking demand dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.2.1 Demand Function Design\n",
        "\n",
        "The demand function integrates five critical factors:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "demand = (α × occupancy_rate +\n",
        "          β × queue_pressure -\n",
        "          γ × traffic_normalized +\n",

        "          ε × vehicle_type_weight)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parameter Justification**:\n",
        "- **α = 0.8** (Occupancy Weight): High influence as primary demand indicator\n",
        "- **β = 0.3** (Queue Pressure Weight): Moderate influence for immediate demand\n",
        "- **γ = 0.2** (Traffic Weight): Negative coefficient - high traffic reduces parking demand\n",
        "- **δ = 0.4** (Special Day Weight): Significant boost during events\n",
        "- **ε = 0.1** (Vehicle Type Weight): Minor adjustment for vehicle-specific demand\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.2.2 Price Calculation Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 1: Demand Normalization**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "normalized_demand = tanh(demand)\n",
        "```\n",
        "The hyperbolic tangent function ensures demand values remain within [-1, 1] range, preventing extreme price fluctuations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 2: Price Adjustment**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "price = base_price × (1 + λ × normalized_demand)\n",
        "```\n",
        "Where λ = 0.6 (price sensitivity parameter)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 3: Bounds Enforcement**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "price = clip(price, base_price × 0.5, base_price × 2.0)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.2.3 Model Assumptions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Linear Demand Relationship**: Individual factors contribute linearly to overall demand\n",
        "2. **Bounded Rationality**: Price sensitivity has upper and lower limits\n",
        "3. **Temporal Independence**: Each pricing decision is independent of historical patterns\n",
        "4. **Uniform Market Response**: All vehicle types respond similarly to price changes\n",
        "5. **Static Base Price**: The reference price remains constant across all locations\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.3 Model 3: Competitive Pricing Model\n",
        "\n",
        "**Justification**: Incorporates spatial competition analysis to maintain market competitiveness while optimizing individual lot performance.\n",

        "competitors = filter(distance <= 2.0km)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Competitive Adjustment Logic**:\n",
        "- **High Occupancy + High Price**: Reduce price to remain competitive\n",
        "- **Low Occupancy + Low Price**: Increase price to match market rates\n",
        "- **Balanced Conditions**: Maintain current pricing strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.3.2 Price Adjustment Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "competitive_adjustment = ±0.3 × (current_price - avg_competitor_price) / base_price\n",
        "final_price = base_price × (1 + λ × normalized_demand + competitive_adjustment)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implementation Benefits**:\n",
        "- **Market Awareness**: Prevents pricing isolation from local market conditions\n",
